  <h1>Hire24</h1>
  <p>This website was made, because I am done with ghosting and unemployment.</p>
  <p>Seeing the same job posts for a week is too much on my mental health and I want a stop.</p>
  <br>
  <p>Instead, you will find job posts that last only 24 hours here!</p>
  <p>New posts every single day, guaranteed by design.</p>
